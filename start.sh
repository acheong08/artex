# ARTEX process supervisor (Linux / macOS / Docker ENTRYPOINT)
#
# Usage:
#   ./start.sh                       Run in the foreground (Ctrl-C to stop)
#   nohup ./start.sh >artex.log 2>&1 &   Run in the background
#   ./start.sh -addr :9000           Pass additional arguments through to artex
#
# It runs artex and uses its exit code to decide whether to restart it.
#
#   0      Normal user shutdown       → exit the loop
#   75     Restart requested by app   → restart immediately (e.g. update or rollback)
#   Other  Crash                      → restart with backoff (1→2→4…up to 60 seconds)
#
# Downloads, SHA256 checks, and binary replacement are intentionally handled by Go
# (the selfupdate package), not duplicated in shell and batch scripts. If a replacement
# binary cannot start, this supervisor would keep restarting it; artex therefore validates
# and installs updates during startup, keeping this script simple.
