Domain and time are only candidate filters and do not establish association. For non-HTTP findings such as TCP, when traffic was not captured, or when there is no exact match, omit this field or pass []; retain other verifiable evidence such as command output and logs in evidence, and consider explaining why traffic was not bound. Do not guess IDs or repeat probing just to capture traffic."
