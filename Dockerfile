# Runtime image (no compilation inside the image): install common tools and add the **precompiled Linux binary**.
# The CI binaries job cross-compiles it (pure Go, no QEMU) and places it at
# dist/<TARGETARCH>/artex in the build context. For multi-architecture builds, arm64 only emulates the apt layer,
# not Next/Go compilation, making builds much faster.
#
# To build the image locally, prepare the binary first:
#   cd web && npm run build:static && cd ..
#   cp -r web/out server/webui/dist
#   CGO_ENABLED=0 GOARCH=amd64 go build -tags embedui -o dist/amd64/artex ./cmd/artex
#   docker build -t artex:local .
